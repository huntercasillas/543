I enjoyed project 1. I have experience in iOS development, so I decided to add a few small extra features. If I didn’t have so much other work due this week I would have liked to add even more. I will probably go back in the future and add a way to edit the pushup entries directly from their table view cell as well as an option to merge entries on the same day into one. One thing I didn’t like was not being able to save an array of my own class in user defaults. I tried making the class Codable, however dates do not support this feature. Instead I had to save 2 arrays, one for the pushups and one for the date and then iterate through both arrays at the same time to create a new pushup object. Other than that the project was a blast to create and finish! I really enjoy designing the UI and color scheme in iOS.
